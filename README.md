this is a fork from [OpenJeDi/HomeAssistantFiles](https://github.com/OpenJeDi/HomeAssistantFiles) without the configuration files (thank you [@OpenJeDi](https://github.com/OpenJeDi) for doing 99.9% of the work).

you can see the fork [here](https://github.com/avlemos/HomeAssistantFiles), which is(was) 4 commits ahead, as of this writing. I only use this for lights, so other elements may be broken.

The main differences are, async usage so that it doesn't bog down on HA, and HACS compatibility, so it's easier to keep up to date.
